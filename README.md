# Cricket-Worldcup-Prediction

##OVERVIEW
This project is built for the prediction of the winner of 2019's Cricket Worldcup. The data for each player and team was scrapped through the website of cricinfo.


## DATA COLLECTION
Data is collected through cricinfo's website by teamwise and playerwise. For that , I have used python and as well as R scripts in some cases.

## TECHNIQUES USED
For prediction, I have used following algorithms.
> Naive bayes.
> Neural Networks.
> Random Forest.

## How to run
You can clone the repository and directly execute the code with the script.
